# Vite multi app

Multi app vue poc

## TODO

- Handle refresh on build
- Handle nested refresh on dev
- Make import .yml work
- Remove code that expects you to understand implicit file structure built by MultiApp script: ex switch/pages/index.vue => `import apps from ../_apps.json` or at least find a way to auto @ts-ignore
- Cleanup client-multi and client-single folders 
- Have some common pages and components
- Manage translations
- Continuous integration
- Nav -> Layout system like Nuxt ?

## Would be nice to add
- Add auth
- Add unit tests (jest?)
- Add e2e tests (cypress)
